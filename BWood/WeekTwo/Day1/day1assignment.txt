Create a new java project called: Dream
Establish a bean class called RocketShip with the fields, numOfRockets, color, model, and hasMiniFridge.
Also include 1 static and 1 instance code block.
In a Driver class, which should be in a different class, instantiate 5 RocketShips and then see if any of those objects match.
If none match, use the appropiate steps to change the fields for 1 object to match another.
Push this project to your branch on the batch repository.
