            Attributes
                    HTML elements can have attributes. Attributes provide additional information
                     about the contents
                    of an element. They appear within the opening tag of an HTML element,
                     and are made of two parts:
                    a name and a value. The name and the value are separated by an equals 
                    sign (=). The value of an
                    attribute is wrapped in double quotes ("").
